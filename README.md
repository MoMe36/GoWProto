* God of War - MoMe Prototype 

This is a GoW prototype project that I intend to use as a base for other projects as well. It features a character controller and gameplay mechanics that are heavily inspired from the latest GoW game, such as: 

* Axe throw/call back 
* Execution of dizzy ennemies 
* More to come 

I'm making the whole project (assets, animations... ) available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rG88O9M3LivEGRU1kTb-iDsBy0Ec5DWS. 
Make sure to check my YouTube channel for the devlog with latest features: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tnGn6Bizwo
I've personally made all assets, with a focus on gameplay, so please don't be too harsh concerning the somehow cubic models or animations ;)
